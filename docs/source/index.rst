Computational Music and Sound Archiving
=======================================
The Computational Music and Sound Archiving system provides high-level audio
feature extraction facilities for multi-viewpoint music similarity analysis.

Music similarity is hard to analyse. A viewpoint highlights certain aspects of
musical perception. Asking for similarity regarding pitch requires another
viewpoint than asking for rhythm similarity.

COMSAR combines pre-selected low-level audio features to *Track*
objects, which represent a viewpoint.
