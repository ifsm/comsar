Timbre Track
****************************************
The Timbre Track is a composition of audio features for timbre preception. The
comsar system combines a mixture of time and frequency domain features.
Additionally, psychoacoustic measures for roughness, and sharpness are
included.

All utilized low-level feature extraction routines are implemented in the
apollon project. Please refer to the respective documentation for
implementation details.

The TimbreTrack includes the following features:

* Spectral Centroid
* Spectral Spread
* Spectral Flux
* Fractal Correlation Dimension
* Roughness
* Sharpness
* Loudness

For further information on theses audio features and their computation checkout the 
apollon API reference.
